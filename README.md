# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise better understand the success rate of her Kickstarter campaigns. I completed this analysis by focousing on the launch dates and the goals of these campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges
- I created a new excel sheet titled "outcome based on goals". In this sheet I created a goals column with the dollar amount ranges. The other colmuns were the number successful, number failed, and number cancelled. I used the COUNTIFS() function on Excel to help me populate these columns by pulling information from the kickstarter sheet. I then created a line graph to help better vizualize and understand my findings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- I found that kickstarter campaigns that were launched in May-June had the highest success rates. This might be due to the fact that summer starts around that time and people are ready to go out and enjoy themselves.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- I found that as the goal for these kickstarter campaigns increased as the success rate of the campaigns decreased. A possible explanation could be that people are intimdated by the campaign goal and refrain from donating.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- A challenge for me was figuring out how to find percentages on excel. I thought there was a function for it but a quick google search explained all you had to do was divide. 
## Results
- One conlusion I can draw is that people go to theateres more during the summer months. Another conclusion that I could draw is there's not alot of plays occuring during the holidays especially around Christmas time.
- From the outcomes based on goals, I can conclude that campaigns with a goal of 10000 or lower have a higher success rate with a few exeptions.
- Some limitations of this dataset include the fact the we didn't compare the launch date and end date. Some campaigns mightve ran a bit longer then the other campaigns and thus met their goal.
- We could create a graph that compares the launch date and end dates with the campaign goal.
